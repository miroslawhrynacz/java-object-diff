# Java Object Diff

This project provides a utility for comparing Java objects and identifying differences between them. It is intended as a foundation for building robust object comparison features, such as those needed for testing, auditing, or data synchronization.

## Features

- Compare Java objects and detect differences
- Designed for extensibility and easy integration
- Pure Java implementation with no external dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/miroslawhrynacz/java-object-diff.git
   cd java-object-diff
   ```

2. Build the project using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).

3. Integrate the object diff utility into your Java project.

## Usage Example

```java
// Example usage (pseudo-code)
MyObject obj1 = new MyObject(...);
MyObject obj2 = new MyObject(...);
ObjectDiff diff = new ObjectDiff();
DiffResult result = diff.compare(obj1, obj2);

if (result.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("Objects are identical.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Differences found: " + result);
}
```
